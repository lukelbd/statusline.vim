# Statusline
This VIM plugin simply modifies the statusline with some handy features. The format is as follows:

```
/path/to/file (git branch) [filetype:filesize] [mode] [caps_lock_indicator]     [ctags_location] [line/nlines] (percent)
```

It optionally integrates with the [tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) plugin, which uses the [exuberant ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) command-line tool, along with the [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin. See the text for details.
